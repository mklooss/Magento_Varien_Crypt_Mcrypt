DEPRECATED since 2017-12-17

I've tried to run Magento 1.9.3.7 on PHP7.2, but there is no MCRYPT

you will also need phpseclib:
modman version: https://github.com/mklooss/Magento_phpseclib

Why modman, we have many store with an modman setup and without composer

installation (modman):
~# modman clone https://github.com/mklooss/Magento_phpseclib.git
~# modman clone https://github.com/mklooss/Magento_Varien_Crypt_Mcrypt.git

currently there is test
